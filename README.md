# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview of the Project
AutoRUs' has a new prototype, the MechCar, but it suffers from production troubles which are in turn hindering the progress of the manufacturing team. The purpose of the project is to review the production data for insights that may aid the manufacturing team at AutosRUs'.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A multiple linear regression analysis was run in order to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

The following shows the results obtained on running the multiple linear regression model:

![]()

The following shows the summary statistics for the model:

![]()

## Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Summary statistics were drawn up on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots, and are shown below:

![]()

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
T-tests were run in order to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

A t-test was run on all the manufacturing lots:

![]()

This was followed by 3 t-tests run on a different manufacturing lot each time:

![]()

## A Study Design to COmpare the MechaCar to the Competition
A statistical study was designed to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
